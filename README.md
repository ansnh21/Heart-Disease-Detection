# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features like:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Serum Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG Results  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Depression  
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia  

The target variable is:
- `1`: Presence of heart disease  
- `0`: Absence of heart disease

## Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Split data into features and target  
3. Split data into training and test sets  
4. Train a logistic regression model  
5. Evaluate model performance  
6. Predict heart disease using new input data

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn
