Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical attributes. The model uses logistic regression for classification.

Dataset
The dataset contains several medical parameters including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other indicators. The target variable indicates whether the person has heart disease (1) or not (0).
